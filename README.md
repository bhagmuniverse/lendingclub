## Purpose
- This case study aims to identify the risky loan applicants using the EDA approachso that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of creditloss.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Strong correlations exist between loan amount, investor amount, and funding
amount
- Annual income is inversely related to the debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
- Annual income tends to increase with years of employment, suggesting a positive
correlation between income and experience
- Loan term impacts default rates, with longer-term loans having higher default rates
- Higher-income ranges are associated with lower default risk
- Loan purpose, grade, interest rate, and employment history significantly affect default
risk
